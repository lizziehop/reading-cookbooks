# Reading Cookbooks
_Reading Cookbooks: Tastemaking in the Atlantic Kitchen_ is a digital critical collection of nineteenth-century American (and, in time, Atlantic/Caribbean) cookbooks. 

## What does that mean? ##
_Reading Cookbooks_ is intended to be a public, open-access way to place cookbooks within their historical, geographical, and temporal contexts: what might the ingredients, methods, and narratives tell us about the cooks and the intended audiences, about gender, labor, and race, and about the systems that reflected and shaped tastemaking within and outside the space of the home.
